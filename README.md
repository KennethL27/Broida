### Discord Bots

In order to run Discord Bots you must first create a [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications) and create one. 
1. Head over to the Developer Portal and sign in with your discord account.
2. Once you successfully sign in go to the "Applications" tab and create a new Application with the "New Application" button on the top right.
3. Create a Name for this new application (or bot) and hit the "Create" button.
4. On the left side cick on "Bot" and on the right side use the "Add Bot" to create the bot. You will need to comfirm by clicking  on "Yes, do it!"
5. You have now created a Bot! Copy the token (next to the Bot's icon) and use it in your code for the bot to run. *Note: Do not give anyone your bot's token! In case the token is shared, use the "Regenerate" button to make sure you Bot is safe.*
6. Before you can actually see you go live, you must invite your bot to a server. On the left side go to "OAuth2"
7. In the "OAuth2" tab, check mark "bot" in the middle column. You will now see more options at the bottom, these options are to grant your bot's permission. For testing sake I suggest check marking "Administrator". This grants all premission to the bot, and most of these permissions can be changed within the server. 
8. With the permissons selected you can copy the link above the permission option and past it in a new tab. Select a server you want to bring the bot into, you must have the permission to manage the server in order to introduce a bot. If you dont have a server with this permission I suggest creating a personal server. 
9. Once you have the server selected, click "Authorize" and begin coding!

### Discord.py

__Windows/Linux__

`pip install discord.py`

___

## Usage
Prerequisites: Python 3.7, Discord.py 1.5.1

For the most basic Discord Bot the following is the base code:

```python
import discord

client = discord.Bot(command_prefix = "!")

@client.event
async def on_ready():
	print('Bot is online')

client.run('Token')
```

Once this simple code has been working correcly with your own bot setup, you may now use functions from Broida(beta).py
