### Discord Bots

In order to run Discord Bots you must first create a [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications) and create one. 

___

## Usage
Prerequisites: Python 3.7, Discord.py 1.5.1

For the most basic Discord Bot the following is the base code:

```python
import discord

client = discord.Bot(command_prefix = "!")

@client.event
async def on_ready():
	print('Bot is online')

client.run('Token')
```

Once this simple code has been working correcly with your own bot setup, you may now use functions from Broida(beta).py
