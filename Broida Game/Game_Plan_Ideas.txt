Ideas
    provide a scoreboard in the gaming channel
        top 5-7 players
        embed message or regular message 
        dont reveal question until reaction are placed
        maybe make a command to get the current scoreboard in case someone wants to check it in another channel
    trivia game
        an embed message
        with reactions as a,b,c,d
        score will be less the longer you wait to answer (like kahoot)
        first reaction is the players choice
    create minigames for other users 
        create their own personal channel 
        something like sudoku to play individual games 
        compete to be the fastest to solve the puzzle 
        top 5 will have different points
