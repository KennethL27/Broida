        "Mass and inertia are the same thing. (Mass actually measures inertia - in kilogramsÂ… Much as monetary resources measures financial wealth - in dollars.)",
        "Weight (force of gravity) decreases as you move away from the earth by distance squared. (It decreases, but only approaches zero, never reaching it, even far beyond the solar system.)",
        "Weight (in newtons) is mass x acceleration (w = mg). Mass is not Weight! Mass is a scalar and measured in kilograms, weight is a force and a vector and measured in Newtons.",
        "Velocity can only be constant when the net force (and acceleration) is zero. (The velocity can be zero and not constant - for example when a ball, thrown vertically, is at the top of its trajectory.)",
        "Velocity, displacement [s], momentum, force (weight), torque, and acceleration are vectors.",
        "Speed, distance [d], time, length, mass, temperature, charge, power and energy (joules) are scalar quantities.",

        "Blue light has more energy, a shorter wavelength and a higher frequency than red light (remember- ROYGBIV).",
        "The electromagnetic spectrum (radio, infrared, visible. Ultraviolet x-ray and gamma) are listed lowest energy to highest. They are all electromagnetic and travel at the speed of light.",
        "The speed (c) of all types of electromagnetic waves is 3.0 x 108 m/sec in a vacuum.",
        "As the frequency of an electromagnetic wave increases its energy increases and its wavelength decreases and its velocity remains constant as long as it doesn't enter a medium with a different refractive index (i.e. optical density).",
        "A prism produces a rainbow from white light by dispersion. (red bends the least because it slows the least).",
        "Transverse wave particles vibrate back and forth perpendicular to the direction of the wave's velocity. Longitudinal wave particles vibrate back and forth parallel to the direction of the wave's velocity.",
        "Light wave are transverse (they, and all (and only)transverse waves can be polarized).",
        "The amplitude of a non-electromagnetic wave (i.e. water, string and sound waves) determines its energy. The frequency determines the pitch of a sound wave. Their wavelength is a function of its frequency and speed. Their speed depends on the medium they are traveling in.",

        "At the critical angle a wave will be refracted to 90 degrees. At angles larger than the critical angle, light is reflected not refracted.",
        "Doppler effect: when a wave source moves toward you, you will perceive waves with a shorter wavelength and higher frequency than the waves emitted by the source. When a wave source moves away from you, you will perceive waves with a longer wavelength and lower frequency.",

        "Coherent light waves are all in phase.",
        "In order to explain the photoelectric effect, Einstein proposed particle behavior for light (and all electromagnetic waves) with E = h f and KEmax = hf Â– Wo.",
        "A photon is a particle of light (wave packet).",
        "To preserve the symmetry of the universe, DeBroglie proposed wave behavior for particles ( l = h/mv). Therefore large fast moving objects (baseballs, rockets) have very short wavelengths (that are unobservable) but very small objects, particularly when moving slowly have wavelengths that can be detected in the behavior of the objects.",

        "As the threshold frequency increases for a photo-cell (photo emissive material) the work function also increases (Wo = h fo)",
        "Increasing light intensity increases the number of emitted photo-electrons in the photo-electric effect but not their KE (i.e. more intensity>more photons>more electrons emitted). This is the particle nature shown by light.",
        "Key to understanding trajectories is to separate the motion into two independent components in different dimensions - normally horizontal and vertical. Usually the velocity in the horizontal dimension is constant (not accelerated) and the motion in the vertical dimension is changing (usually with acceleration of g).",
        "Centripetal force and centripetal acceleration vectors are toward the center of the circle- while the velocity vector is tangent to the circle. (Centripetal means towards the center!)",
        "An object in orbit is not weightless - it is its weight that keeps it moving in a circle around the astronomical mass it is orbiting. In other words, its weight is the centripetal force keeping it moving in a circle.",
        "An object in orbit is in free fall - it is falling freely in response to its own weight. Any object inside a freely falling object will appear to be weightless.",

        "Fusion is the process in which hydrogen is combined to make helium.",

        "There are two types of Hadrons: Baryons and Mesons (see Chart).",
        "The two types of Hadrons are different because they are made up of different numbers of quarks. Baryons are made up of 3 quarks, and Mesons of a quark and antiquark.",
        "Notice that to make long-lived Hadron particles quarks must combine in such a way as to give the charge of particle formed a multiple of the elementary charge.",
        "For every particle in the 'Standard Model' there is an antiparticle. The major difference of an antipartcle is that its charge is opposite in sign. All antiparticles will anhililate as soon as they come in contact with matter and will release a great amount of energy."
